We've been developing a Go-based web framework with the following key features and characteristics:

Dual-mode operation (development and production)
Single Page Application (SPA) support
Efficient file serving with optimized production mode
Advanced caching system using a Cache-Aware Request Coalescer
Dynamic resource-aware caching that adjusts based on system memory
Template management with caching
Static file serving
Flexible routing for web and API endpoints
JSON API support
Production optimizations for high-concurrency environments
Development-friendly features for easier debugging
Modular design for extensibility
Error handling and logging
Configuration via command-line flags
Efficient content loading combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Thread-safe operations

Recent optimizations include:

Eliminating unnecessary runtime checks by setting file reading functions at startup
Implementing a dynamic cache that adjusts its size based on available system memory
Creating a cache-aware request coalescer to prevent redundant processing of simultaneous requests

Areas for potential further development include:

Enhancing the routing system
Improving template rendering and management
Expanding API capabilities
Adding middleware support
Implementing more sophisticated error handling and logging
Developing a plugin system for easy extensibility
Creating a CLI tool for project scaffolding and management
Improving configuration management
Enhancing security features
Implementing database integrations
Adding support for WebSockets or server-sent events
Developing a testing framework specific to the web framework

The framework aims to balance performance, especially in production environments, with developer-friendly features for rapid development. There's still work to be done to make it a comprehensive, production-ready web framework.
